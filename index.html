            Hello! My name is Mohamed, and I‚Äôm passionate about higher
            education, global program management, and creating impactful
            opportunities for students. I graduated with my Master of Science in
            Education in Higher Education Administration last May and currently
            work at New York University as a Global Opportunities Administrator.
            When I‚Äôm not working, I enjoy exploring new cultures, experimenting
            with creative recipes, and delving into DIY projects.
          </p>
